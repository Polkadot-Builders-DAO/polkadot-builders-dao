          Polkadot Builders is a community owned DAO, making a positive impact in the Polkadot
          ecosystem by funding the creation of public goods and proliferating Nounish culture. From
          designers, to developers, to marketers, anyone can be a builder.

          We believe there are a lot of skilled people in the ecosystem that WANT to build, but
          donâ€™t know WHAT to build, or have a team to work with. Polkadot Builders is an
          experimental attempt to bring together creative minds regardless of their skills /
          professions to create public goods.

          Nouns have done an amazing job at bootstrapping culture, community and governance to
          create one of the most well known web3 brands. The noggles in the crest are a tip to the
          Nouns and Lil-Nouns communities, a way to bring the eyes in Polkadot to amazing projects
          like Nouns and as a reminder to create, try, iterate and be nounish.
